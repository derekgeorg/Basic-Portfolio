# My First Portfolio

## Overview

##### Project Link: (https://derekgeorg.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)

This project was my first portfolio assignment at the *UT Austin Coding Boot Camp*. 

Basic HTML and CSS coding was used to create this three page website.

A Navbar and Footer are included on each page.

Profile image, portfolio images and background images were stored within the project and relative paths used to link.
