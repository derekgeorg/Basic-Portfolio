# My First Portfolio

## Overview

##### Project Link: (https://derekgeorg.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)

This project was my first portfolio assignment at the *UT Austin Coding Boot Camp*. 

Basic HTML and CSS coding was used to create this three page website.

Profile image, portfolio images and background images were stored within the project and relative paths used to link.

### All Pages are composed of:
* A Navbar with logo/name and links to About, Portfolio and Contact

* One main 960px content section

* A footer with top border and text
