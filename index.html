        <h4>{Hello World}</h4>
        <p>My name is Derek Georg.
            I am an aspiring full stack web developer with a focus on the MERN stack.</p>
        <p>I am a passionate technologist with 5+ years of experience in leading digital transformation in an IT Management and Executive role.</p>
        <p>In January 2019, I decided to make a pivot in my career and deepen my understanding of web application development.</p>
        <p>I enrolled in the Coding Boot Camp at The University of Texas - Austin. This 24-week intensive program focused on gaining technical programming skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, NodeJS, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handlebars.JS and ReactJS. </p>

        <p>In my previous role as Chief Systems Officer, I led the digital transformation of a mobile healthcare organization. My team and I introduced innovative cloud-based applications and strategies to increase operational productivity and business continuity.</p>
        <p>I have a proven ability to communicate with all levels of an organization to help identify and improve business challenges
            using emerging technology solutions.</p>
        <p>I am an enthusiastic learner with a knowledge and interests in technology trends in cloud-based enterprise
            applications, digital media, marketing, design and development.</p>
