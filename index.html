        <h4>{Hello World}</h4>
        <p>My name is Derek Georg. I'm a junior full stack web developer with 5+ years of experience leading in an IT Management and Executive role.</p>

        <p>In January 2019, I decided to make a pivot in my career and deepen my knowledge of web technologies by enrolling in the Coding Boot Camp at The University of Texas - Austin. </p>

        <p>This 24-week intensive program focused on gaining technical programming skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, NodeJS, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handlebars.JS and ReactJS. </p>

        <p>In my previous position as Chief Systems Officer, I led the digital transformation of a mobile healthcare organization. My team and I introduced cloud-based applications and strategies to increase operational productivity and business continuity. I now aim to combine my prior experience and knowledge with my new technical skill set to further my passion of impacting the workforce of the future through innovative technology solutions.</p>

        <p>I am an enthusiastic learner with interests in technology trends across multiple industries, including business, education, healthcare, media and marketing. </p>

        <p>My current study interests include ReactJS, React 360, ServiceNow and Google Cloud Platform. </p>

        <p>My hobbies include photography and videography with drones (DJI Phantom 4 Advance), 360Â° cameras (Samsung Gear 360) and the newest mobile devices (Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy). I also enjoy serving my community as Vice President on our local elementary's PTA Executive Board.</p>
